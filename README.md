### Some markdown hints...
#### Here is 4 \#  
##### Here is 5 \#  
###### Here is 6 \#  
Using a single \# = First level heading.
Double \#\# =  second level  
Three \#\#\# = third level  
Should be a horizontal rule  
---
```
And this should be a new line  
Add 2 or more spaces then hit \<Enter\> for a new line
Here's a fun one...  
$~~~~~~~~~~$$ git commit -m.  <-The period after means you don't have to add a message   
  
I want to see if I can get a new line with 2 spaces at the start of a blank line
```
Backticks block = Code block. Makes an upper right 'copy' button
