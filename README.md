### Some markdown hints...
Using a single \# = First level heading.
Double will be second level  
Should be a horizontal rule  
```
And this should be a new line  
Add 2 or more spaces then hit \<Enter\> for a new line
Here's a fun one...  
$~~~~~~~~~~$$ git commit -m.  <-The period after means you don't have to add a message   
  
I want to see if I can get a new line with 2 spaces at the start of a blank line
```
Backticks block = Code block?
